		    <h1>Block Blast</h1>
		
		    <p>Block Blast is an offline game. It is similar to Tetris. The game has two mini games. In the first mini game, the goal is 
		    to eliminate the blocks either vertically or horizontally to get a high score. The game will first give you three random blocks 
		    which you will put in the 8x8 grid. The second mini game has the same goal as the first but as a challenge,
		    find out the other details by yourself. Enjoy playing!</p>
